	abstract  ="We review the history of the parallel tempering simulation method. From its origins in data analysis{,} the parallel tempering method has become a standard workhorse of physicochemical simulations. We discuss the theory behind the method and its various generalizations. We mention a selected set of the many applications that have become possible with the introduction of parallel tempering{,} and we suggest several promising avenues for future research."}
